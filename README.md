A 42 project to learn about networks

### Level 1: What is an IP Address?

IP address is short for Internet Protocol Address. It is the address which identifies a device in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol suite (TCP/IP) for communication, such as the internet.

Most common are IPv4 IP addresses like this one:

  192.168.110.222

IPv4 stands for Internet Protocol version 4. It defines the IP address as a 32-bit number. This means 4 times 8 bits. Thus an IPv4 address can range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. 

As the internet is growing and there are not enough IPv4 addresses for all the devices, IPv6 addresses have been introduced. These use 128-bit numbers, such as:

  2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1

8 times 16 bits by using 4 hexadecimal numbers for each of the 8 positions. 

There are ip4 and ip6 addresses.
ip4 look for example like this:
  104.96.23.12
(explain further)

If two devices are on the same network, they share the first 3 positions, only the fourth differs. (This is all you need to know for level 1).
