A 42 project to learn about networks

### Level 1: What is an IP Address?

IP address is short for Internet Protocol Address. It is the address which identifies a device in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol suite (TCP/IP) for communication, such as the internet.

There are ip4 and ip6 addresses.
ip4 look for example like this:
  104.96.23.12
(explain further)

If two devices are on the same network, they share the first 3 positions, only the fourth differs. (This is all you need to know for level 1).
